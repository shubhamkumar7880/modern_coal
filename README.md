              the help of a third party API. Along with that, it also calculates
              the price of the coal according to it's rate and quantity. Along
              with that, it also adds gst, cgst, cess and other charges and
              convert the whole price in words which is also editable. Prices
              and descriptions can also be customized using HSN code. All bills
              are stored in localstorage, so that, we don't have to eneter the
              bill number again and again. Along with these features, all data
